# class `Result` (early alpha-version)

This is a Result implementation in Python.

`Result` type represents  retult of opreation that can finish succesfully or not (with an error). It is an alternative approach to handle exceptions, where result either has sucessful value (`Ok`), or the value of an error (`Err`).

This approach allowes to handle errors and exceptions in more controlled and predictable way.

It will be made in such a way that it would be possible to drop it into a project.
